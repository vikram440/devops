Cheeku the Clever Rabbit
In the jungle of Junglepur, there lived a smart little rabbit named Cheeku. He was always curious and loved trying new things.

One day, the Lion King made an announcement:
"Whoever brings the most unique thing will win a special prize!"

All the animals got busy. Some brought rare flowers, some shiny stones, and others colorful butterflies.

But Cheeku didn’t bring anything in his paws.

When the Lion asked, “What did you bring?”

Cheeku smiled and said, “I brought something special — an idea!”

The Lion was surprised. “An idea?”

Cheeku explained, “What if we build a shared water pond in the jungle? Then no animal will ever be thirsty in the summer. I’m ready to help build it myself.”

The Lion was impressed and said,
“You have brought the most unique thing — wisdom and kindness!”

Cheeku won the prize, and all the animals joined hands to build the pond.

Moral: The most valuable things are not always objects — sometimes, a good idea and a kind heart are the most special of all.
